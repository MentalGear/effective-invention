This will become, hopefully, an effective invention.

## Getting started

Make sure you have Node.js available locally.

Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill in the blanks.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the application server locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will now be available at https://localhost:3000.
